                <h3>Mission</h3>
                <p>In this year 2022, My mission is to become a Front End Developer. For this reason, I have already
                    started to learn HTML, CSS. Then, I have to learn javascript & react js effeciently.

                <p>To grow my learning ability, I have to stay focused to day to day learning. By this way, I may grow
                    my confidence also. Then, I will move for back end development.

                <p>To accomplish something, we always have to set a goal. The path will not be easy. But we have to go
                    through it. My final goal is to become a full stack web developer.

            <p>To become a full stack web developer is not a one or two days task. It will take long time hardworking,
                huge perseverance & determination. To grow my confidence & up my level, I must give a huge time for
                coding practice. To develop myself for effeciency, I have to practice more and more.

            <p>For learning purpose, beside practising I also have to get attached with some global community. Through
                this way, I can come to learn many unknown things. I also ask my many problems about coding in this
                community. I can learn here by my mistakes, can share my project & can help others.
